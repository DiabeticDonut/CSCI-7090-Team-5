# Privacy Policy Analysis in Healthcare – Systematic Literature Review

# Overview
This project presents a systematic literature review on privacy policy analysis in healthcare, focusing on automated techniques, readability assessments, and regulatory compliance. With the rise of digital health applications, including mHealth platforms, concerns over data privacy, security, and transparency have become increasingly critical.

The review synthesizes existing research, examining the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and knowledge graphs to analyze privacy policies, detect contradictions, and assess alignment with legal frameworks such as HIPAA and GDPR. Key challenges identified include lack of standardized readability metrics, static compliance assessments, and limited integration of security and privacy frameworks.
